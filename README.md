# Software Engineering Group Project
Team 13

THIS IS A GROUP PROJECT FOR TEAM 13; PLEASE FOLLOW THIS LINK FOR THE COMPLETE CODE: https://github.com/adorkable17/software-eng-s21

My sub group (search engine) had trouble collaboring in git at the time due to our inexperience and as such we uploaded the continually developing code to a Google Drive folder which was shared with Justine Catli

This is the repository of our unsucessful first attempt at colaborating with git: https://github.com/ataul-ui/search_recipes
